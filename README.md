# Understanding the public opinion on Artificial Intelligence

## Overview

The aim of this work is to:

* Gain a general understanding about the opinion of people, what they think about artificial intelligence. Therefore it aims to understand what are the feeling and the sentiment of people, are they excited or do they fear this technology? 
* Try to understand  whether are present or not different conversation topic about this subject. Maybe there will be a group of people or organisation that promote AI while others will be more skeptical and criticize it. 
* Investigate what are the words that are most common in the negative sentiment tweets and in the positive one in order to understand if there is a potential correlation between these terms and the emotions.

This analysis will be carried out by using Tweets, firstly because it guarantees open data despite other platforms but even because of the large amount of available content.
